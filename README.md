Smartphones are one of the fastest-growing technologies in human history. With the tumbling data price (per GB) and increasing internet speed over the second half of the decade 2010â€“2020, the number of smartphone users has increased multifold. China, India and the US are the countries with the highest number of smartphone users, and together, they contribute to about 50% of the global smartphone userbase. 

In this capstone project, I haved worked with lakhs of user review data for various mobile phones obtained from the Amazon website. The intention of analysis for this data will be to derive information and insights that will help business functions such as product development and marketing.

The following technical skills are used in this capstone project:

* Data cleaning and wrangling
* Text analytics
* Naive Bayes model
* Tableau dashboarding and data storytelling 

**Text analytics** and building a **Naive Bayes model** for text classification are two new skills that I have learnt as part of this capstone.
